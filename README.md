<!-- ## Installation Instructions -->

<!-- 1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ``` -->

<!-- 1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd capstoneproject
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   FLASK_APP=app
   FLASK_ENV=development
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   S3_BUCKET=your_s3_bucket_name
   S3_KEY=your_s3_key
   S3_SECRET=your_s3_secret
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   flask run
   ``` -->

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository (only this branch).

2. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment.

4. Make sure the SQLite3 database connection URL is in the **.env** file.

5. This starter organizes all tables inside the `flask_schema` schema, defined
   by the `SCHEMA` environment variable. Replace the value for
   `SCHEMA` with a unique name, **making sure you use the snake_case
   convention.**

6. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your
   Flask app:

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

7. The React frontend has no styling applied. Copy the **.css** files from your
   Authenticate Me project into the corresponding locations in the
   **react-vite** folder to give your project a unique look.

8. To run the React frontend in development, `cd` into the **react-vite**
   directory and run `npm i` to install dependencies. Next, run `npm run build`
   to create the `dist` folder. The starter has modified the `npm run build`
   command to include the `--watch` flag. This flag will rebuild the **dist**
   folder whenever you change your code, keeping the production version up to
   date.
